    "As the third largest oil producer (__[U.S Energy Information Administration, 2022](https://www.eia.gov/international/rankings/world)__), Russia has a big influence towards the global oil price. The geopolitical landscape, especially with the on-going war between Russia and Ukraine, has further strengthened this impact. As a result to the war, Ukraine imposed a ban on natural gas and oil exports in February 2024 (__[Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine, 2022](https://tsoua.com/en/news/ukraine-stops-exporting-natural-gas/)__), intensifying the energy crisis in Europe and leading to fluctuated change in oil prices. \n",

    "The main objective of this research is to see the impact and correlation between the change of oil prices on the logistics performance in the Netherlands before and after the Russia-Ukraine energy dispute in 2022. The Netherlands, as a key logistics hub in Europe and heavily dependent on fuel for its freight and transportation operations, was significantly impacted by the fluctuating oil prices caused by these geopolitical developments. \n",
